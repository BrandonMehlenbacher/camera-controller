XCLIB, "Forceful Allocation" technique allows reserving almost
all the computer memor(up to 4 GB on 32bit machines( for image frame buffers

host memory allocated for image frame buffers

frame buffer allocated on boot, stays until reboot

#xcap is setting the number of frames based on image size
#in the video file format

#31 images at 32 MB (32768 kB actually)
#3856 images (1024x1024) with memory at 4194 MB (4**22)

#try 8388608

#Windows 7 64 bit only allocates 6 GB or 1/2 of the total memory-- whichever is smaller
Tried 6GB, still have

maximum memory = 65536 = 64 gb
change to 4
only got 249 images
Installed RAM says 64 GB, 2.71 GB usable

BCDEdit, made a new boot loader entry with truncated memory, then choose to boot from this
-IA 4194304 -IM 62914560 -MB 0

60355 images (1024x1024) when set up with:


regedit:
Edit the registry for the epix frame grabber through the regedit software that you can access by typing regedit in the start menu.
*navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SYSTEM -> CurrentControlSet -> services -> EPIXXCW64
Edit -> New -> String Value with name PIXCI and value:
-IA 4194304 -IM 61865984 -MB 1048576 -BH 1048576 -MU 0x01 -MU 0x03
where -IA is for the number of KB for the OS (4 GB), -IM is the number KB for EPIXX (59 GB)
DONT go into Enum

bcdedit:
Tell the computer to isolate some memory from windows to save it for the frame grabber by making a new boot loader and truncating the memory.
*from the start menu, type "cmd", then right click on the cmd program to start it as an administrator
bcdedit /enum
bcdedit /copy {current} /d "Windows7 [PIXCI==59G NT=4G"
to copy the current boot loader and rename it
bcdedit /enum /v
to get the ID of the new entry to use in this line:
for 4GB of memory (entered in units of bytes):
bcdedit /set <new_entry_id> truncatememory 1073741824
1 GB was slow listed as:
0x40000000

msconfig:
*General:
select: selective startup, check load system services, check load stertup items, DONT Use original boot configuration
*Boot:
select: the boot loader you created with bcdedit
select set as default
click apply
