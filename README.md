camera-controller
=================

User interface to control digital cameras. In particular, we develop this software for cameras attached to microscopes.

We write this in a modular way-- anticipating it will be used with different cameras and frame grabbers in the future. Currently, we are using it with a PhotonFocus camera, an Epix frame grabber, and a Nikon inverted microscope.

This software is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers DMR-1306410 and DMR-1420570.
