This includes step by step directions for how to install this software on a Windows 7, 64-bit machine to work with a Photon Focus camera and an EPIX frame grabber.
(includes some info from dependencies.txt and memory_notes.txt)

Get the EPIX frame grabber working to display images from the camera and get the PFRemote software working to control the camera....

1. Physically install the frame grabber (with your computer off and unplugged) and install the XCAP driver for the frame grabber here http://www.epixinc.com/support/files.php
2. Restart Computer, open XCAP, use this product ID to setup XCAP-lite 58VU/Y7KV/N4ZU
3. Install Photon Focus's PFRemote software here http://www.photonfocus.com/en/support/software/?no_cache=1
4. For PFRemote to recognize the frame grabber, the appropriate clserEPX.dll file must be copied to the directory c:\Windows\System32\ (for 64bit XCAP and 64 bit PFRemote). The "appropriate" clserEPX.dll file is the API 1.1 version for x86_64 systems (64bit). See documentation here http://www.photonfocus.com/fileadmin/web/applicationnotes/AN0032_e_V1_0_PFRemoteSDK_and_Win64bit.pdf

*NOTE* The EPIX frame grabber will not appear in the list of frame grabbers when PFRemte is opened if step 4 is not completed!

*NOTE* For computers where another camera link frame grabber is installed (i.e. for the ANDOR Zyla) the clserEPX.dll file may need to be placed in a different directory. Find the directory that your other frame grabber's clser***.dll file is located in and copy the clserEPX.dll file into the same folder. For the computer with the the Andor Zyla camera, this folder is c:\BitFlow SKD 5.60\Bin64\

You should now be able to use the XCAP software to view a live stream from the camera and the PFRemote software to set the camera parameters.

Get python camera controller GUI working...

1. Install Pixci XCLIB from here (64 bit) http://www.epixinc.com/support/files.php . 
	Use the code VTON/XRJF/GSIN and use the default directories for everything.
	Make sure that this file is here 'c:\program files\epix\xclib\xclibW64.dll'
2. Install Anaconda based Python (we use Python 2.7) from here https://www.continuum.io/downloads
	Install for current user only (The installer fails on 64-bit windows if you try to install it for all users).
3. Add the package PySide by opening the Anaconda command prompt and running "conda install pyside"
4. Download or clone the camera controller software from https://github.com/manoharan-lab/camera-controller
5. Run the camera_controller_gui.py with the program 'C:\Users\manoharanlab\Anaconda2\Scripts\ipython2.exe' 

You should now be able to use the camera control software to view images coming from the camera and save time series.
However, only a small amount of the computer's RAM will be available to the frame grabber.

Configure computer memory so large videos can be saved...
See the PIXCI XCLIB reference manual for more details on this forced memory allocation.

1. Type regedit into the start menu and open regedit.exe
*navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SYSTEM -> CurrentControlSet -> services -> EPIXXCW64
Edit -> New -> String Value with name PIXCI and data:
-IA 4194304 -IM 61865984 -MB 1048576 -BH 1048576 -MU 0x01 -MU 0x03
where -IA is for the number of KB for the OS (4 GB), -IM is the number KB for EPIXX (59 GB)
******for 12-52 GB memory split use -IA 12582912 -IM 54525952 -MB 1048576 -BH 1048576 -MU 0x01 -MU 0x03 *************
DONT go into Enum

2. Tell the computer to isolate some memory from windows to save it for the frame grabber by making a new boot loader and truncating the memory.
*from the start menu, type "cmd", then right click on the cmd program to start it as an administrator
List the boot loaders with the command:
	bcdedit /enum
Copy the current boot loader and rename it:
	bcdedit /copy {current} /d "Windows7 [PIXCI==59G NT=4G"
Again list the current boot loaders with the command, but with details:
	bcdedit /enum /v
Find the identifier for the new boot loader with the description "Windows7 [PIXCI==59G NT=4G"
For me the identifier was {ef091aa6-1c49-11e6-bd71-f8b156cddbc6}
Run the following command  to set the memory Windows gets. Replace <new_identifier> with the identifier value for the new boot loader:
	bcdedit /set <new_identifier> truncatememory 4294967296
	******for 12-52 GB memory split use bcdedit /set <new_identifier> truncatememory 12884901888 *************
Again, list the boot loaders with
	bcdedit /enum /v
The value of tuncatememory should be 0x100000000 for the 4GB (4294967296) value specified.

3. Setup the boot sequence:
Type msconfig in the start menu and run msconfig.exe
Go the the *General* tab and make the following changes:
	select: selective startup, check load system services, check load stertup items, DONT Use original boot configuration
Go to the *Boot* tab and make the following changes
select: the boot loader you created with bcdedit, select set as default
click apply

4. Restart the computer

The operating system will now have 4GB of memory available and the frame grabber should have access to 59GB.

NOTES on memory inputs:
The -IA address is specified in kBytes. It should be equal to or greater than the value used for truncatememory, which was specified in Bytes. 1 kByte = 1024 Bytes. Or 4 GBytes = 4194304 kBytes = 4294967296 Bytes. This page is useful http://www.whatsabyte.com/P1/byteconverter.htm
The -IM value is in kBytes. It should be the total system memory minus the -IA address, minus 1GB(to be safe).
See the PIXCI E4 manual, Frame Buffer Memory Allocation Section for you approprate OS for more details.
